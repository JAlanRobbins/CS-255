# CS-255: Reflection Prompt

Our client, DriverPass, wanted a system that would help new drivers pass their driving exams by supplying a paid for service that offers the reservation of Driving Tests
and Online Quizzes in an attempt to increase the passing rate of new drivers during their driving exams at the DMV. They wanted an online only system that they did not
want to personally manage, that would be accessible from a web browser. 

I believe that some aspects of these projects that I am personally proud of and that I feel I did well are the business requirements. 
I believe that I provided detailed notes of what the client requested and thought intently about the requirements and necessities of the system 
that needed to be included in the systems implementation. 

If there was one thing that I feel that I could have revised and made better would be the diagrams. I think that I could have spent more time in another 
software and got a better result than I did with the software that I chose, mostly because it was a trial software and it limited the amount of what I could put into
the diagram. There were some diagrams that I definitely feel that could have been put more into for a more polished poroduct that would better describe what 
the system would actually accomplish.

I feel as though I thought of the user when I was thinking of the User UI, in that I would highly prioritize making it easy for the students to reserve driving tests and
see their scores for onlie quizzes and putting that as the focus on the students main page. I want the Students to be able to easily get what they need and to see the
progress that they ahve made through this program. Whenever you are programming something for client you have to remember that ultimately this thing that you are creating 
is not just something you are creating to get a paycheck, this is something that other people will be using, not only in just the sense that there is an end user but 
you are also creating these things to help someone else accomplish what they ultimately want out of the product. 
For DriverPass it is a goal that you want more people to be able to pass their driving exams. Even I had trouble trying to pass my exams becuase I did not have someone to
teach me how to drive. I think the message that I am trying to convey is that there are people behind the products and people in fornt of the products, who are all trying 
to achieve something out the code you write and ultimately what you write will have an impact on the user. 

I feel as though that my style of programming is almost amateurish and backwards where I think of ultimately what I want the product to do and then start writing from 
there without actually planning. This is definitely not how I have been learning to program over the past couple of months as I have come to realize just how important 
planning is to programming, mostly because in a professional setting there would be absolutely no way for a client to really trust someone that would just "wing" their code.
Keeping the clients needs and the users that will be using your code in mind and having a strong sense of plannning and the necessary requirements that the system needs, 
these are things that make the best programmers, when you can plan ahead and create product that checks all of the boxes and works without (or minimal) bugs. That's the 
type of programmer that I aspire to be.
